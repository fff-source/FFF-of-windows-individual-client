FFF Network Node Description
==========================
 

FFF network is a fully distributed computing system, distributed storage system and distributed application based on blockchain, which constructs a cloud operating system running on blockchain. The distributed cloud service platform with low cost, high expansion, low latency, privacy security, big data and artificial intelligence is realized, which thoroughly solves the problems of data island, giant monopoly, privacy leakage and high cost of traditional cloud storage service. The open operating system based on LUA virtual machine intelligent contract is integrated, which greatly reduces the technical cost for developers to use blockchain technology. As a WEB3.0, it will provide the basic underlying security for the future development of science and technology such as metadata, communication technology, cloud computing, cloud storage, big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and unmanned equipment. At the same time, it supports the rapid deployment of ' alliance chain ' to protect privacy and data security while sharing data as required.

First of all, thank the global developers for their strong support and contribution to the FFF network. After a long time of environmental stress testing, in the FFF network officially open to the world, in order to the healthy development of the FFF network, prevent evil, maintain the stability of the network, ensure the authenticity and reliability of effective data storage, and protect the integrity and permanent storage of user file information, the underlying system at the beginning of the development set a certain network entry conditions and variable functions, namely the underlying economic model. Now do the following instructions :

1. The activation of the node ' miner ' that provides FFF network computing power needs to meet the following conditions ( ' mining ' mechanism ) :
1. Node token pledge
2. Destruction of entry tickets

1. Node pledge, minimum threshold : 5 FFF / T, return to the pledge node cycle. FFF prices fluctuate freely with the market.

2. Net entry tickets, minimum threshold : 5 MFIL / T, net entry destroyed. MFIL is a constant price.
The number of tokens required for node pledge and ticket entry varies with the change of network computing power according to the function threshold, so as to balance the sharp decrease and increase of computing power and maintain the stability of the network.

#Re-entrant : After the pledge period, if you need to continue to do the node, then re-entrant activation node.

#punishment mechanism ; in order to ensure the stability of the FFF network and the integrity of the file information, the node failure is not repaired for more than 48 hours, that is, the node stops the service, fines the pledged currency, and stops the currency reward release. It is necessary to re-enter the network to activate the node. After the node works normally, the unreleased currency will continue to be released.
